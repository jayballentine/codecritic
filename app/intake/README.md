# File JSON Conversion Module

## Overview
This module provides a comprehensive file analysis pipeline designed to convert files into structured JSON representations with multi-stage processing capabilities.

## Features
- Support for multiple file types (Python, JavaScript, Markdown, Text, JSON)
- Detailed file metadata extraction
- Code complexity analysis
- Batch processing capabilities
- Business impact reporting

## Processing Stages

### 1. Individual File Analysis
- File type validation
- Content extraction
- Import detection
- Code complexity metrics calculation

### 2. 10-File Batch Analysis
- Aggregate individual file analyses
- Compute batch-level statistics
- Track processing errors

### 3. Merged Batch Analysis
- Consolidate findings across batches
- Generate cross-file insights
- Summarize global complexity metrics

### 4. Business Impact Analysis
- Translate technical findings into business context
- Assess potential risks and optimization opportunities

## Supported File Types
- `.py` (Python)
- `.js` (JavaScript)
- `.md` (Markdown)
- `.txt` (Plain Text)
- `.json` (JSON)

## Error Handling
- Robust error tracking
- Graceful failure for unsupported file types
- Detailed logging of processing issues

## Usage Example

```python
from app.intake.file_json_conversion import (
    convert_file_to_json, 
    process_file_batch, 
    merge_batch_analysis, 
    generate_business_impact_report
)

# Convert a single file
file_analysis = convert_file_to_json('path/to/your/file.py')

# Process a batch of files
batch_results = process_file_batch(['file1.py', 'file2.py', ...])

# Merge multiple batch analyses
merged_analysis = merge_batch_analysis([batch1_results, batch2_results])

# Generate business impact report
business_report = generate_business_impact_report(merged_analysis)
```

## Performance Considerations
- Designed for scalable file processing
- Minimal overhead for individual file analysis
- Configurable batch processing size

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced language-specific parsing
- More granular complexity metrics
- Machine learning-based risk assessment
