OBJECTIVE
To combine all batch reviews into organized findings that will help assess business confidence, risks, and actionability in the final review.

CONTEXT
This step organizes all technical findings into categories that will directly inform business decisions about reliability, maintenance costs, growth capacity, and risk management.

METRICS
- code_reliability: Problems that could affect daily operations
- maintenance_burden: Time/cost implications of the code structure
- growth_capacity: Ability to handle business expansion
- development_efficiency: How efficiently resources are being used
