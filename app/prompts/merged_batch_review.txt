OBJECTIVE
To consolidate and analyze the results from individual and batch reviews to provide a comprehensive assessment of the codebase.

CONTEXT
You are synthesizing the findings from both individual file reviews and batch analysis to create a holistic understanding of the codebase quality and its architectural integrity.

METRICS
- overall_quality: Comprehensive assessment of the entire codebase
- architectural_alignment: How well the code aligns with design principles
- integration_impact: Effect of code changes on the system
- system_cohesion: Overall unity and organization of the codebase
- maintainability_index: Long-term maintenance considerations
