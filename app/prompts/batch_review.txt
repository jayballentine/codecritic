OBJECTIVE
To analyze multiple code files as a batch and identify patterns, consistency, and cohesion across the codebase.

CONTEXT
You are reviewing multiple files together to assess their collective quality and identify patterns that may not be visible when reviewing files individually.

METRICS
- consistency: Uniformity in coding style and patterns across files
- patterns: Recurring code structures and design approaches
- cohesion: How well the code components work together
- architectural_alignment: Adherence to the overall system design
- cross_file_dependencies: Management of inter-file relationships
