OBJECTIVE
To analyze groups of code files together to spot patterns, strengths, and potential issues that affect reliability and maintainability.

CONTEXT
You are examining multiple files as a group to understand how well they work together, identifying both positive patterns and areas needing improvement that will inform our overall project assessment.

METRICS
- consistency: How uniform and predictable the code is across files
- patterns: Common approaches and their impact on reliability
- cohesion: How logically organized and connected the code is
- design_alignment: How well the code follows a clear structure
- file_relationships: How different parts of the code depend on each other
