  "plain_english_summary": "Think of your software like a house. Right now, it's a solid build with good foundations (7/10), but there are some areas that need attention to make it a great long-term home for your business.

What's working well:
- Consistent use of well-established design patterns and frameworks, which provides a reliable technical foundation
- Comprehensive error handling and modular, extensible architecture, ensuring the software is stable and can adapt to future needs

What needs fixing:
- Your login system is too tightly connected to other parts of your software. It's like having a single key that opens every door in your building - if you need to change the locks, you have to change everything.
- The way you handle sending and managing emails could cause delays, similar to a clogged pipe disrupting water flow in your home.
- There are some minor inconsistencies in how you name and organize things, like having mismatched furniture in different rooms.

Why it matters to your business:
- These issues could mean more time (and money) spent on future changes, higher risk of problems when making updates, and slower performance as your user base grows.
- Fixing them will improve maintainability, scalability, and reliability, making your software a better long-term investment.

What happens if these issues are fixed vs. left alone:
- Fixing the problems will smooth out the kinks in your software, like renovating an older home. It'll run better, be easier to upgrade, and support your business as it grows.
- Leaving them unfixed is like living with a leaky faucet or cluttered garage - it works, but causes frustration and limits what you can do with the space in the long run."
