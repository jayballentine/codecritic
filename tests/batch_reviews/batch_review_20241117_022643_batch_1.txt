"batch_summary": {
  "Overall, the code batch exhibits a high level of consistency, reliability, and maintainability. The code organization and design patterns used are well-structured and follow best practices for API development with FastAPI. The codebase demonstrates strong patterns in areas like authentication, authorization, and email communication management.

  The key areas for improvement include:
  1. Separating email sending and queue management into distinct modules for better separation of concerns and improved maintainability.
  2. Standardizing the import styles across the codebase to ensure a consistent and predictable code structure.
  3. Exploring the use of a dedicated message queue service to enhance the scalability and reliability of the email processing functionality.

  Addressing these areas will further improve the overall reliability, maintainability, and scalability of the application, making it better prepared to handle future growth and changes.
