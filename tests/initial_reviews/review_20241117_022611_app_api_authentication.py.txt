 "summary": "The auth_routes.py file provides a well-designed and secure set of API routes for handling user authentication in the application. The code follows best practices, is highly readable and maintainable, and is well-documented, making it easy for both developers and non-technical stakeholders to understand and work with. There are no major reliability, maintenance, or growth concerns identified, and the overall quality of the code is very good. The only potential area for improvement is adding more detailed logging and monitoring to the authentication functions to improve visibility and troubleshooting. Overall, this file represents a strong foundation for the application's authentication functionality."
