 "summary": "The users table is well-designed and follows best practices for storing user account information. It has a clear purpose, straightforward structure, and good documentation, making it easy to understand and maintain. The table is also optimized for performance with the use of indexes. 

However, there are some potential security concerns around storing sensitive user data like email addresses that should be reviewed. Additionally, the limited subscription types may constrain future flexibility as the business evolves.

Overall, this file sets a strong foundation for the user management functionality of the application. With some minor improvements to security and scalability, it should provide a reliable and maintainable user data storage solution to support the business's needs."
