 "summary": "The main.py file contains the core functionality of the application, handling user requests and coordinating with other components. While the code is reasonably straightforward and handles errors well, it lacks comprehensive documentation and has a somewhat disorganized structure. This could make it challenging for new developers to understand and maintain the application over time. Additionally, the application's design is not very flexible or reusable, which could limit its ability to adapt to changing business requirements or scale to meet growing demands. To address these issues, the team should focus on improving the documentation, refactoring the code to be more modular and better organized, and considering a more flexible, reusable design for the application."
