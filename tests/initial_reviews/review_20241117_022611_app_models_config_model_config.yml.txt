  "summary": "The models.py file defines the primary and backup machine learning models used in the application, both of which are industry-leading language models provided by OpenAI. This file is well-structured and follows best practices, making it easy to maintain and update as needed. However, the application's performance and reliability are dependent on the continued availability and functionality of the OpenAI services, which is an external factor that may limit the application's long-term growth potential. Regular monitoring of the OpenAI models and exploring alternative model options in the future could help address this concern."
