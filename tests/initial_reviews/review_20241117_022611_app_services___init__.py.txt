 "summary": "This file contains the core business logic services that power the critical functionality of the application. The services follow best practices for modularity, security, and reusability, which is a major strength. However, there are some areas for improvement, such as adding more inline documentation and enhancing error handling, to ensure the services remain reliable and maintainable as the application grows. With some targeted improvements, these services will provide a solid foundation for the business to scale its operations."
