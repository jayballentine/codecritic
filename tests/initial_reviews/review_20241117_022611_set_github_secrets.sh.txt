 "summary": "This script is generally well-written and easy to understand, which makes it straightforward to maintain. It reliably sets GitHub repository secrets using values from a .env.test file, which is an important task for ensuring the security and reliability of your software project. However, the script could be improved by adding more robust error handling and better documentation to make it more resilient and easier for new team members to work with. Additionally, increasing the script's reusability and test coverage would help ensure it can continue to support the project's growth and evolution over time."
