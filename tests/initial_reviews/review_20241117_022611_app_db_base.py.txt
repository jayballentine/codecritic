 "summary": "The DatabaseClient class in this file provides a well-designed and easy-to-use interface for managing the Supabase database connection in the application. The code follows best practices, is well-organized and documented, and includes error handling to ensure reliability. However, there are a few areas for potential improvement, such as enhancing the error handling and logging, and considering a more generic database abstraction layer to improve long-term flexibility. Overall, this file represents a solid foundation for the application's database functionality and should support the business's needs well."
