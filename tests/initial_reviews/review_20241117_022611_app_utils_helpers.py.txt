     "concerns": {
       "reliability_issues": ["The email validation function doesn't handle all possible edge cases, such as emails with unusual characters or top-level domains.","There is no explicit handling for malformed API response data that could cause issues downstream."],

 },
 "summary": "The utility functions in this file, while generally well-designed and documented, have some areas for improvement to ensure they can reliably support the project's long-term needs. The email validation function could be made more robust to handle a wider range of valid email formats, and the API response formatting function could benefit from additional error handling and input validation. Overall, the functions are easy to maintain and reuse, but increasing their flexibility and test coverage would help future-proof them as the project grows and evolves."
