 "summary": "The AuthService class in this file provides a well-designed and secure solution for handling user authentication in the application. The code follows best practices, is easy to understand and maintain, and includes robust error handling and logging. This helps ensure the reliability and stability of the authentication system, which is critical for the success of the project. While there are no immediate concerns or urgent fixes required, the team should consider regularly reviewing the Supabase service for any updates or changes that may require updates to the AuthService class. Additionally, as the project grows, the team may want to explore adding additional authentication methods to meet evolving user needs and provide a more seamless and secure experience."
