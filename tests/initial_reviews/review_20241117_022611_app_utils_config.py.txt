 "summary": "The config.py file in this application is well-designed and implemented, providing a reliable, maintainable, and flexible way to manage the application's configuration settings. The file includes clear validation of critical environment variables, handles both Supabase and traditional PostgreSQL configurations, and provides a straightforward API for retrieving configuration values. This ensures that the application has the necessary configuration to run reliably and can easily adapt to changes in the future. Overall, this file is a strength of the codebase and should continue to serve the application well as it grows and evolves."
