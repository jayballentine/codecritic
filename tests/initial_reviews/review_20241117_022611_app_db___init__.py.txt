 "summary": "This file sets up and manages the database connection for the application, including initialization, sessions, and migrations. Overall, the code is well-written and follows best practices, making it reliable, maintainable, and scalable. The key strengths are the abstraction of the database integration, robust error handling, and modular design. The main concerns are potential threading issues with global session objects and the complexity of the initialization process, which could make onboarding new developers more difficult. To address these issues, the team should review the use of global objects, maintain clear documentation, and consider streamlining the setup process. With these improvements, the database integration will be well-positioned to support the ongoing growth and development of the application."
