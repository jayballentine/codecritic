 "summary": "Overall, this file contains the core functionality for managing software repositories and initiating code reviews. The code follows industry standards for security and error handling, which is a strength. However, there are opportunities to improve the simplicity and maintainability of the codebase, which could impact the long-term reliability and growth potential of the system. Addressing these concerns through targeted refactoring, improved documentation, and a focus on modular design will help ensure that this critical component of the application continues to meet the business's needs as requirements evolve."
