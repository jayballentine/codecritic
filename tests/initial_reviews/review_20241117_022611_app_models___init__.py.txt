 "summary": "This file contains the well-designed data models and validation schemas that are the foundation of the application's data infrastructure. The models are clearly defined, follow best practices, and support the long-term reliability, maintainability, and growth of the software. While no major issues were identified, there are some minor opportunities to further enhance the documentation and comments to make the codebase even more accessible to new developers. Overall, this is a strong, well-implemented component that will serve the business well."
