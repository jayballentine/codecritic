 "summary": "This file contains a collection of utility functions and helper classes that provide common functionality used across the application. The code is well-organized, follows best practices, and is easily reusable, which is a significant strength. However, some areas for improvement have been identified, such as enhancing error handling and expanding documentation and test coverage. Addressing these issues will help ensure the utility functions continue to work reliably and can be easily maintained and extended as the application grows."
