 "summary": "The session_manager.py file provides a well-designed and comprehensive session management system for the application. It uses secure encryption, handles errors effectively, and follows best practices for session management. The code is modular and easy to maintain, and the session management functionality is scalable and adaptable to changing user needs.

However, there are a few areas where the code could be improved to further enhance its reliability and maintainability. The lack of explicit handling for race conditions and the use of environment variables for the encryption key could potentially introduce issues in a production environment. Additionally, while the code is extensible, it may benefit from more explicit support for customization and integration with other authentication systems.

Overall, the session_manager.py file is a strong component of the application's security and user management features, and with some targeted improvements, it can continue to serve the business's needs effectively."
