 "summary": "The database migration scripts in this project are well-organized, follow industry best practices, and utilize a popular migration tool (Alembic) to manage database schema changes. This ensures that the database structure can be reliably and consistently updated over time, and allows the project to scale and evolve as the business needs change. While no major concerns were identified, there may be opportunities to further improve readability and maintainability by adding more detailed documentation and comments within the migration scripts."
