 },
 "summary": "The logging setup in this file is generally well-designed and implemented, providing a reliable and maintainable logging system for the application. The code is clear, well-organized, and follows best practices, making it easy for developers to understand and work with. 

However, the lack of comprehensive unit tests and the absence of a dedicated configuration file may introduce some challenges for the long-term maintenance and scaling of the logging functionality. Additionally, the current logging setup lacks more advanced features that could be beneficial as the application grows and evolves.

Overall, the logging setup in this file is a solid foundation that will serve the application well, but there are a few areas that could be improved to further enhance the reliability, maintainability, and scalability of the logging system."
